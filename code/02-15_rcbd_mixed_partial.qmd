# Introduction  
The goals of this exercise are to:  
- Create an analytical workflow for an **RCBD** with **random blocks**, from data import through publication-ready plot  
- Understand each of its components  

# a) Setup  
Here is where we load the packages we will use.  
```{r setup}
# Loading packages
library(tidyverse) # for data wrangling and plotting
library(car) # for Anova function
library(lme4)
library(broom) # for model residuals extraction
library(emmeans) # for model mean extraction
library(multcomp) # for pairwise comparison letter display
library(Matrix)
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE**:  
We are using in this exercise the same data set as the one used for the CRD exercise. This is only for **teaching purposes!!**  

In your own analysis, you should always analyze a given designed study data set based on the design that it was implemented with.  
You should NOT analyze a given designed study with a different design than what it was implemented with.  

This is not an option!  

```{r data import}
rcbd_df <- read_csv("../data/wheat_nk_balkh.csv")

rcbd_df
```

# b) EDA tables  
```{r summary}
summary(rcbd_df)
```

```{r glimpse}
glimpse(rcbd_df)
```
# c) Wrangling
```{r rcbd_dfw}
rcbd_dfw <- rcbd_df %>%
  mutate(rep = factor(rep),
         nrate_kgha = factor(nrate_kgha),
         krate_kgha = factor(krate_kgha) 
         ) %>%
  mutate(trtname = paste0(nrate_kgha,"+",krate_kgha))

rcbd_dfw
```


```{r rcbd_dfw}
summary(rcbd_dfw)
```
Number of replicates: 4  
Number o treatments: 3 N rates x 3 K rates = 9  
Number of observations: 4 x 9 = 36  
Yield: from 2795 to 7445 kg/ha  

# d) EDA plots  
```{r n boxplot}
ggplot(rcbd_dfw, aes(x = nrate_kgha, 
                    y = yield_kgha,
                    color = nrate_kgha)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

```{r k boxplot}
ggplot(rcbd_dfw, aes(x = krate_kgha, 
                    y = yield_kgha,
                    color = krate_kgha)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

```{r nk boxplot}
ggplot(rcbd_dfw, aes(x = nrate_kgha, 
                    y = yield_kgha,
                    color = nrate_kgha)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter() +
  facet_grid(.~krate_kgha) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

# e) Statistical model  
## Mixed-effect modeling in R  

Now that we are going to treat **blocks as random effect**, we will need to use a different function.  

That is because `lm()` only handles one variance component (the error itself).  

To account for more than one variance component (i.e., random effects and error), we can use function `lmer()` from package `lme4`.  


```{r model}
# Changing to sum-to-zero contrast
options(contrasts = c("contr.sum", "contr.poly"))

# Model fitting
rcbd_mix_mod <- lmer(yield_kgha ~ nrate_kgha*krate_kgha +
                       (1|rep), data = rcbd_dfw)

rcbd_dfw
# Summary
summary(rcbd_mix_mod)
```

Notice now how the `summary()` above has a new section for **random effects**.  

The variance attributed to blocks is 59932, and that still left in the residual error is 376416. 

Therefore, blocks are responsible for 59932 / (59932 + 376416) = **14% of the total noise** in this model.  

# f) ANOVA table  
```{r ANOVA}
Anova(rcbd_mix_mod, type=3)
```
Notice how this table is now titled "Analysis of Deviance Table". That's because we are using REML instead of mean squares.  

Also notice how rep (i.e., block in this case) does not appear in the ANOVA table above. That's because it only displays **fixed effects**.

As before, since the interaction is significant here, we should extract means and perform pairwise comparisons for the interaction term.

Before we do that, let's check our model assumptions. Remember, a model is only valid for inference (i.e., means and pwc) IF if fulfills the linear model assumptions.  

# g) Linear model assumptions  
## Extracting residuals
First, let's extract our model residuals, and also create studentized residuals.  

```{r rcbd_mix_resid}
library(broom.mixed)
rcbd_mix_resid <- augment(rcbd_mix_mod) %>%
  mutate(.studresid=rstudent(rcbd_mix_mod))

rcbd_mix_resid
```

Now, let's recap the linear model assumptions:  

- Independence (no pattern)  
- Variance homogeneity (homoscedasticity)  
- Normality  
- Outlier detection (< -3 or > 3)  

One difference in mixed models is that the 3 first assumptions are also applied to the **random effects**, so we need to check it for them as well.  

### Random effects are iid ~ N(0,var_a)  
```{r randeff_rep}
randeff_rep <- ranef(rcbd_mix_mod)$rep

randeff_rep
```

For random effects with so few levels (i.e., 4 since that's the number of blocks), the QQ plot is one of the only ways to check for assumptions on random effects.  

```{r QQ plot for random effects}
ggplot(randeff_rep, aes(sample=`(Intercept)`))+
  stat_qq(  shape = 21,
            fill = "purple", 
            size = 3,
            alpha = .7
  )+
  stat_qq_line()+
  labs(x = "Theoretical quantile",
       y = "Sample quantile")+
  theme_bw()
```
Nothing to worry here, especially since we only have 4 points.  

### Within-group errors are iid ~ N(0, var_e)  
```{r }
ggplot(rcbd_mix_resid, aes(x=.fitted, y=.studresid))+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color="red")+
  geom_point(shape = 21,
             fill = "purple", 
             size = 3,
             alpha = .7)+
  geom_smooth()+
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(-3,3), color = "red")+
  theme_bw()
```

- **Independence**: seems liker there is a potential pattern, but since error bands comprise 0 on the y-axis, I'm not worried.  

- **Variance homoscedastic**: seems constant across the x-axis.   

- **Outliers**: nothing outside the -3,3 boundaries.  


```{r}
ggplot(rcbd_mix_resid, aes(sample=.studresid))+
  stat_qq(  shape = 21,
            fill = "purple", 
            size = 3,
            alpha = .7
  )+
  stat_qq_line()+
  labs(x = "Theoretical quantile",
       y = "Sample quantile")+
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
ggplot(rcbd_mix_resid, aes(x=.studresid))+
  geom_density(color = "black",
               fill = "purple",
               alpha = .7)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-3,0,3), limits = c(-3,3))+
  theme_bw()

```

- **Normality**: residuals seem normal.  

# h) Model means  
The next step in the workflow is extracting the model means.  

Remember that it is at this level that we establish the hierarchy of how our pairwise comparisons will be performed.  

Let's extract it by comparing everything to everything else.
```{r interaction means all}
rcbd_mix_means_all <- emmeans(rcbd_mix_mod, ~nrate_kgha:krate_kgha)

rcbd_mix_means_all
```

# i) Pairwise comparisons  
Now that we extracted means, let's perform pairwise comparisons among them.  

```{r interaction pwc all}
rcbd_mix_cld_all <- cld(rcbd_mix_means_all, 
                   reversed=T, 
                   adjust="none",
               Letters=letters)

rcbd_mix_cld_all
```

Let's do some light wrangling here to be able to plot these.  

```{r selected pwc}
rcbd_mix_cld_selected <- rcbd_mix_cld_all %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  mutate(letter=trimws(.group)) %>%
  mutate(trtname = paste0(nrate_kgha,"+",krate_kgha))

rcbd_mix_cld_selected
```

# g) Final plot  
Let's plot our results, including both **raw data** (for allowing our audience to inspect data distribution) and **statistical model summary (i.e., letter separation)** for inference purposes.    
Let's make this plot publication ready.  

```{r rcbd final plot}
ggplot(mapping = aes(fill = trtname))+
  # Raw data and boxplots  
  geom_boxplot(data = rcbd_dfw,
               aes(x = trtname, y = yield_kgha),
               alpha = .8) +
  geom_jitter(data = rcbd_dfw,
               aes(x = trtname, y = yield_kgha),
              shape = 21,
              size = 3,
              alpha = .6) +
  # Adding letters
  geom_label(data = rcbd_mix_cld_selected,
            aes(x = trtname, y = emmean, label = letter),
            fill = "white") +
  labs(x = "N rate + K rate (kg/ha)",
       y = "Yield (kg/ha)") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none")

ggsave("../output/rcbd_mix_means.png",
       width = 8,
       height = 5)
```
